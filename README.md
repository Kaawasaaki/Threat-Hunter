**Threat Hunter** is a Python-based tool designed for Windows systems to help security analysts, incident responders, and system administrators quickly identify suspicious activities. It scans for common persistence mechanisms and indicators of compromise, providing a clear, tabulated output for easy analysis.

This tool is perfect for initial triage on a potentially compromised machine to gather quick intelligence.

##  Key Features

Threat Hunter automates the search for anomalies across various parts of the Windows operating system.

*   **Suspicious Processes**: Identifies running processes that are not signed by Microsoft.
*   **Third-Party Services**: Lists running services that are not part of the core Microsoft operating system.
*   **Non-System Scheduled Tasks**: Finds scheduled tasks created by users or applications, filtering out default system tasks.
*   **Startup Programs**: Scans common registry run keys (`HKLM`, `HKCU`) for programs configured to launch at startup.
*   **Active Network Connections**: Shows all established TCP connections and the processes that own them.
*   **Recently Accessed Files**: Lists files recently opened by the user, which can help trace an attacker's activity.
*   **Failed Logon Attempts**: Scans the Windows Security Event Log for failed logon attempts (Event ID 4625), a common sign of brute-force attacks.
